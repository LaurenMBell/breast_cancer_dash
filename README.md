This is a project of Lauren Bell's to practice using R Shiny, 
data viz, design principles, creating ML models, and working with 
transcriptomics and radiomics data. 

This is the dataset I used, METABRIC. I just found it on Kaggle: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raghadalharbi/breast-cancer-gene-expression-profiles-metabric

Features:
- different reactive visualizations of cohort, with interactive filtering
- ML survival time calculator
